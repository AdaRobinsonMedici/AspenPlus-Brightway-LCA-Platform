Ready-to-use open-source <strong>Python</strong> framework automatically integrating <strong>Aspen Plus</strong> process simulations with the Python-based <strong>Brightway</strong> package to conduct Life Cycle Assessments (LCA). We demonstrate the approach on a well-studied, solvent-based post-combustion <strong>carbon capture</strong> system using Monoethanolamine (MEA) through streamlined <strong>Jupyter</strong> notebooks.
