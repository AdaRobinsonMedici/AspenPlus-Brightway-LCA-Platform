# AspenPlus-Brightway-LCA-Platform
Ready to use open-source Python framework automatically integrating Aspen Plus process simulations with the Python-based Brightway package to conduct Life Cycle Assessments (LCA). We demonstrate the approach on a well-studied, solvent-based post-combustion carbon capture system using Monoethanolamine (MEA) through streamlined Jupyter notebooks.
