    "To provide some theoretical background, Brightway is based on the theory of computational structure for LCA. If a clean separation between products and processes is given, the technosphere matrix A can be directly modeled by activities (or nodes) for the processes and exchanges (or edges) for the products. However, Brightway modified this notation over the years, since many databases it builds on and utilises do not exhibit a clean separation between processes and products. This means that an activity can be both process and product and is therefore referenced in both technosphere rows and columns, leading to an abstraction of the original approach. For more information, the following references are recommended:\n",

    "It is assumed that LCA practitioners are familiar with the procedure of generating the LCI. However, to facilitate starting with computational LCA, some advices for the workflow are provided:\n",

    "* Please note you have to be careful with respect to the versions of Brightway. Up to now, AB is only compatible with Brightway 2.0.\n",
    "* However, working with the GUI facilitates the design of the LCA, especially in the initial phase when defining its goal and scope.\n",
    "* A typical workflow could be to first create the LCI in AB and then extract the structure (activities and exchanges) to an Excel file. Then, this structure can be used to create its own brightway project, which is fully customizable.\n",
